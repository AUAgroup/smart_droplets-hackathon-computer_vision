        "### 0) Motivation (why this matters)\n",
        "\n",
        "Conventional blanket spraying misuses pesticides and fertilizers, driving pollution and exposing farm workers to hazardous chemicals. Smart Droplets aims to flip that script: fusing autonomous retrofit tractors with Direct Injection Systems (DIS), AI models, and a Digital Farm Twin to **spray only where needed**. Your mission in this hackathon directly fuels that vision—detecting apple scab symptoms at leaf/fruit level so the sprayer can make **precise, traceable, Green-Deal-friendly** decisions in the field.\n",

        "## 1) Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Build and improve a **semantic segmentation pipeline** that finds **Scab** symptoms in apple-tree imagery.\n",
        "2. Use the provided **train/val/test** splits; the test masks are hidden.\n",
        "3. Start from the **working baseline code** (provided) and **improve** it.\n",
        "4. Submit a **folder of predicted masks** (one per test image) generated by your pipeline.\n",

        "* **Loss**: class imbalance handling—**BCEWithLogits + Dice**, **Focal**, or **Tversky**; consider **combo losses** (e.g., `0.5*BCE + 0.5*Dice`).\n",
        "* **Architecture**: try stronger encoders (e.g., ResNet/ConvNeXt backbones), **DeepLabV3+**, **UNet++**, or lightweight models for speed.\n",
        "* **Optimization**: AdamW, one-cycle or cosine LR, early stopping, gradient clipping, AMP (mixed precision).\n",

        "* **Validation rigor**: stratified sampling by scene, consistent seed, proper normalization.\n",
        "* **Inference**: test-time augmentation (TTA), sliding window for large images, model ensembling (if time).\n",

        "* **Leakage**: **Do not** use test images for training, hyper-tuning, or augmentation fitting.\n",
        "* **Automation**: Your pipeline must run end-to-end from a single command.\n",
